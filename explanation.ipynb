    "## Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cumulative History**: Each interaction adds to the growing conversation history. The LLM always receives the complete conversation from the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**No Selective Memory**: The LLM doesn't just get \"recent\" messages - it gets everything from that session.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fresh Processing**: The LLM processes the entire conversation as if seeing it for the first time each round. It doesn't retain anything between calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Token Cost**: This means longer conversations use more tokens since you're sending the full history each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context Preservation**: This approach ensures the LLM has full context for every response, which is why it can reference things said earlier in the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly how systems like ChatGPT work - they maintain the illusion of memory by always sending the complete conversation history with each new message."
